# Portfolio Website

This is a responsive personal portfolio website built with **HTML** and **CSS**. It serves as a showcase of my projects, work experience, open-source contributions, and educational background. The goal of this project was to practice semantic HTML, clean CSS architecture, responsive design, and dark mode implementation — all without using any CSS frameworks.
